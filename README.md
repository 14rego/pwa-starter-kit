# PWA Starter Kit -- `template-no-redux`

This sample app is a starting point for building PWAs. Out of the box, the template
gives you the following features:
- all the PWA goodness (manifest, service worker)
- a responsive layout
- application theming
- offline UI
- simple routing solution
- fast time-to-interactive and first-paint through the PRPL pattern
- easy deployment to prpl-server or static hosting
- unit and integrating testing starting points
- documentation about other advanced patterns.

This template has the same UI elements as the `master` one (`app-layout` elements, theming, etc), but does not use Redux for state management. Instead, it does a properties-down-events-up unidirectional data flow approach, where the data source of truth is mutable, and individual elements (specifically, each view) own parts of the entire application state.
