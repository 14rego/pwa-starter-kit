# PWA Starter Kit - template-minimal-ui

This sample app is a starting point for building PWAs. Out of the box, the template
gives you the following features:
- all the PWA goodness (manifest, service worker)
- a responsive layout
- application theming
- example of using Redux for state management
- offline UI
- simple routing solution
- fast time-to-interactive and first-paint through the PRPL pattern
- easy deployment to prpl-server or static hosting
- unit and integrating testing starting points
- documentation about other advanced patterns.

This template uses Redux for state management like the `master` template, but doesn't use any of the `app-layout` elements (app-header or app-drawer) for the responsive UI.
