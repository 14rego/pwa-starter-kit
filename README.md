# PWA Starter Kit -- `template-responsive-drawer-layout`

This sample app is a starting point for building PWAs. Out of the box, the template
gives you the following features:
- all the PWA goodness (manifest, service worker)
- a responsive layout
- application theming
- Redux for state management
- fast time-to-interactive and first-paint through the PRPL pattern.
- deployment to AppEngine

This template is very similar to the `master` template, in the sense that it keeps both Redux for state management, and all of the UI elements. The main difference is that the wide screen layout displays a persistent `app-drawer`, inline with the content.
